    <h1>Quelle est l'histoire</h1>
    <p>During the Ancien RÃ©gime, the oriflamme, the flag of Saint-Denis,<br> was used -- red, with 2, 3 or 5 spikes. Originally, <br>it was the personal flag of Charlemagne, given to him by the Pope in the 9th century.<br> Over the time, it became the royal banner under the Carolingians and the Capetians.<br> It was stored in Saint-Denis abbey, where it was taken when war broke out.</p>
